# Contribution Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Find an issue to work on or create a new branch. If adding a new feature, create a issue first to discuss about it.
3. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
4. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Make sure your code lints.
7. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the NC-MIT Software [License](/license)

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [NC-MIT License](/license) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/himasnhu-at/fastsearch/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Himasnhu-AT/FastSearch/issues/new) it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

Great Bug Reports tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happened
- Notes (possibly including why you think this happened and what you think might be happening)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `cargo fmt` to format your code before submitting.

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its [NC-MIT License](/license).

## V0.0.3-beta

Fast Search, implementation of end-to-end Google's Search Engines whose core is written in Rust. The benchmark of the project will be released soon. This repo is built to ensure the privatization of search engine technology, such that organizations/individuals can build their own search engine which only parses certain repositories to ensure that the results received are from trusted websites (/sources) that are accepted by them.
